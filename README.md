# Ender-s-Video-Game

-- I'm targeting mac users (and possibly pc gamers as well)
-- I'll be using either Unity or PyGame, probably PyGame as I've tried using Unity before, with no success
-- I hope to create a sort of Ender's Game Battle video game. It'll be like your average turn-based battle game, but in 3D!
-- Well, both PyGame and Unity are designed specifically for video game creation, so I think both would work well. Unity is more 
   flexible, but also a lot harder to learn. PyGame is easier to learn, but slightly more limited. As this game doesn't exactly 
   require the most complicated inner workings, I think PyGame will serve me better.
